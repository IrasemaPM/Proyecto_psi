	abstract = {We present here several variants of a mathematical model to explore three main issues related to SARS-CoV-2 spread in scenarios similar to those present in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitigation policies. Given the early stage at which the epidemic is at the date of writing in Mexico, we hope these ideas can be helpful for the understanding of the importance of isolation, social distancing and screening of the general population.Key findingsWe have estimated the parameters of the epidemic curve (growth rate, carrying capacity and dispersion) as well as a first estimate of the basic reproduction number for Mexico.We provide expected trends of epidemic outbreaks depending upon of the number of imported cases per day arriving to a large airport. We illustrate this trends with data from Mexico City airport.We provide expected trends of disease dispersal depending upon of the number of exported cases per day either by airplane or bus. We illustrate this trends with data from Mexico City.We evaluate the effect of behavioral change to reduce the contact rate and compare diverse scenarios that evaluate the timing of initial enforcement of behavior, time horizon in which to diminish the contact rate and the proportion of people under isolation.We evaluate the effect of social isolation by itself with respect to two main parameters: the starting time for the enforcement of control measures, and the learning time to achieve the desired contact rate reduction. We stress the importance of quick and direct actions to isolate and reduce contact rate simultaneously.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementno external funding receivedAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

abstract = {Treatment with antiviral drugs (zidovudine and ddI) has been reported to delay progression to AIDS, and may even possibly lower the infectiousness of the infectives. However, its effect on the community level is still uncertain. The latter is important since a successful community treatment program must meet both public health and individual health goals. Our study will focus on the effect of a community-wide treatment program initiated at the early stages of the disease as well as the long-term effect of the program. using a simple mathematical model, we demonstrate that a community-wide treatment program could be instrumental in decreasing HIV incidence rate and eradicating the disease in the future if certain conditions on the parameters are met. On the other hand, when the above mentioned conditions on the parameters are not satisfied, we show that even if the treatment does improve survival in AIDS patients and decrease the rate at which HIV infection spreads in the community, it is still possible for the treatment program to have an adverse effect on the spread of AIDS in the population in the long run. Hence, a public health policy maker must exercise caution in order to design an effective treatment program for HIV/AIDS.}

In the present work, we discuss the theoretical impact of introducing a vaccine across a range of scenarios. In particular, we investigate how vaccination coverage, efficacy and delivery time affect the control of the transmission dynamics in comparison to mobility restrictions. The analysis is based on a metapopulation epidemic model structured by risk. We perform a global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method. Our analysis suggest that the reduction of mobility among patches plays a significant role in the mitigation of the disease close to the effect of immunization coverage of 30\% achieved in four months. Moreover, for an immunization coverage between 20\% and 50\% achieved in the first half of 2021 with a vaccine efficacy between 70\% and 95\%, the percentage reduction in the total number of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections is between 30\% and 50\% by the end of 2021 in comparison with the no vaccination scenario.},

In this work, we review the theory behind some important mathematical models that have been used to answer questions raised by the development of the pandemic. We start revisiting the basic properties of simple Kermack-{McKendrick} type models. Then, we discuss extensions of such models and important epidemiological quantities applied to investigate the role of heterogeneity in disease transmission e.g. mixing functions and superspreading events, the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the control of the pandemic, vaccine deployment, herd-immunity, viral evolution and the possibility of vaccine escape. From the perspective of mathematical epidemiology, we highlight the important properties, findings, and, of course, deficiencies, that all these models have.},

abstract = {About a year into the pandemic, COVID-19 accumulates more than two million deaths worldwide. Despite non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distance, mask-wearing, and restrictive lockdown, the daily confirmed cases remain growing. Vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna, and Gamaleya Institute reach more than 90% efficacy and sustain the vaccination campaigns in multiple countries. However, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but the new SARS-CoV-2 variants demand to inquire if the vaccines will be highly protective or induce permanent immunity. Further, in the first quarter of 2021, vaccine supply is scarce. Consequently, some countries that are applying the Pfizer vaccine will delay its second required dose. Likewise, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. Therefore, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Following some of the WHO-SAGE recommendations, we formulate an optimal control problem with mixed constraints to describe vaccination schedules. Our solution identifies vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. These optimal policies ensure the vaccination coverage of a prescribed population fraction in a given time horizon and preserve hospitalization occupancy below a risk level. We explore “via simulation” plausible scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced, and natural immunity. Our simulations suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and reinfection periods would play a dominant role in mitigating COVID-19.}
